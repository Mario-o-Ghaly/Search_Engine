# Search-Engine
 ## Overview
 This is a search engine utilizing *Object-Oriented Programming* in **C++** without using any GUI. Its main focus is on updating a webpage rank using the impressions, number of clicks, CTR, and score along with trying to analyze and design the most efficient algorithm.

 This project was developed by the author individually in Spring 2022.

 ## Mechanics
 The user is given at the beginning 2 choices, whether to do a **New search** by entering 1 or **Exit** by entering 2.

 If they choose to search, they enter what they want to search for, and the results appear on the terminal ordered by their rank.

 After that, the user is given 3 options: **Open a webpage**, **New search**, or **Exit**.

 If the user chooses to open a webpage, They will be asked to enter its order, and then a message will be viewed indicating that they are viewing the webpage chosen.

 The user could then choose to go back to search results, do a new search, or exit, and the process goes on.

 ## User Guide
 If you want to try the search engine, download the whole folder and run the file named **a.exe**.
